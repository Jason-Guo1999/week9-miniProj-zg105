# IDS706-Week3-MiniProj
In this mini project, I read students' scores from data.csv. Then used Pplars to analysis the data and created data visualization by main.py. The output shows the distribution of input data.csv file. The lib.py file stores code shared by main.ipynb and test_main.ipynb. The generate.py is used to generate class_grades.csv
