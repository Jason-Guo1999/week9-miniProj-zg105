# IDS706-Individual-Proj1
In this individual project, I read students' scores from class_grades.csv. Then used Polars to analysis the data and created data visualization by main.ipynb. The output shows the distribution and summary of input class_grades.csv file. The lib.py file stores code shared by main.ipynb and test_main.ipynb. The generate.py is used to generate class_grades.csv
